      question: "How does the evaluation work?",
      answer:
        "Our evaluation process consists of a trading challenge where you need to demonstrate consistent profitability while following our risk management rules. You'll trade in a simulated environment that mirrors real market conditions.",
    },
    {
      question: "What happens after I pass the evaluation?",
      answer:
        "Once you successfully complete the evaluation, you'll receive access to a funded trading account where you can trade with our capital and keep a significant portion of the profits you generate.",
    },
    {
      question: "When can I request my first payout?",
      answer:
        "You can request your first payout seven calendar days after placing your first trade on the funded account, provided you've made profit for at least three separate days. After that, you're eligible for weekly payouts every Friday, as long as you continue to follow all risk rules.",
    },
    {
      question: "What withdrawal options are available if I paid via UPI?",
      answer:
        "We support multiple withdrawal methods including bank transfers, UPI, and cryptocurrency options. The method you choose for withdrawal doesn't need to match your payment method.",
    },

      question: "Can I hold trades over the weekend?",
      answer:
        "Yes, you can hold positions over the weekend. However, be aware that weekend gaps and Monday opening prices may affect your positions due to news events that occur when markets are closed.",
